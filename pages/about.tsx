                I have a background in English Literature and Creative Writing and worked for many years in the
                hospitality industry. In 2020 I combined my love of English with my passion for working with and meeting
                new people. I now teach in a language school here in Berlin as well as online.

                There is nothing I love more than helping people to reach their goals with confidence. I know that
                learning a language can sometimes be stressful, and it can be difficult to stay motivated, so I aim to
                make it as fun and stress-free as possible.

                I teach CEFR levels A2-C1, using a textbook, combined with other materials to help consolidate grammar
                in a simple, fun, and understandable way. These classes involve a good amount of conversation, to
                practice producing what you&apos;ve learnt, and reach a greater level of fluency more quickly. I will
                also provide written homework exercises for writing practice.
            </p>
            <p className="para">
                If you&apos;re not interested in reaching a certain level, and just want to improve your speaking skills
                - you can book a conversation class instead. Here, we will talk about a wide array of topics using
                conversation prompt questions. If you have a particular area of interest, I&apos;m happy to create a
                list of questions specific to this topic.
