            I have a background in English Literature and Creative Writing and worked for many years in the hospitality
            industry. In 2020 I combined my love of English with my passion for working with and meeting new people. I
            now teach in a language school here in Berlin as well as online.

            There is nothing I love more than helping people to reach their goals with confidence. I know that learning
            a language can sometimes be stressful, and it can be difficult to stay motivated, so I aim to make it as fun
            and stress-free as possible.

            I teach CEFR levels A2-C1, using a textbook, combined with other materials to help consolidate grammar in a
            simple, fun, and understandable way. These classes involve a good amount of conversation, to practice
            producing what you&apos;ve learnt, and reach a greater level of fluency more quickly. I will also provide
            written homework exercises for writing practice.
        </p>

            If you&apos;re not interested in reaching a certain level, and just want to improve your speaking skills -
            you can book a conversation class instead. Here, we will talk about a wide array of topics using
            conversation prompt questions. If you have a particular area of interest, I&apos;m happy to create a list of
            questions specific to this topic.
